# Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word
# in the string.
# If the last word does not exist, return 0.
# Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.
# Please make sure you try to solve this problem without using library functions. Make sure you only traverse the string
# once.
